Here we examine an example with simulated data.
In order to generate data from a model with given 
  baseline hazard $h_0(\cdot)$ and
  frailty distribution $F(\cdot)$
  we note that %times have survival function
\begin{equation*}
  S = S(t \mid U = u) = S_0(t)^u \sim U(0, 1),
  \qquad t \ge 0,
\end{equation*}
  with $S_0(t) = \log\left(\int_0^t h_0(s) \mathrm d s\right)$ the baseline survival function.

Therefore we can first simulate the frailty values $u$ from their distribution $F_U(\cdot)$
  and then generate survival times as
\begin{equation*}
  t = S_0^{-1}(s^{-u}),
\end{equation*}
  with $s$ realizations of $S$.
